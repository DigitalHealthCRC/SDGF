    "When re-identification risk is more than very low, synthetic data must be treated as personal information under privacy law. Use or sharing may proceed only under a suitable lawful pathway and with appropriate approvals.",
    "Examples include: seeking a waiver of consent via an HREC for research, relying on statutory authorities where applicable, or proceeding under explicit legal permissions with proportionate safeguards.",
    "This appendix clarifies typical documentation, governance conditions, and oversight mechanisms for different pathways, and links to the Decision Tree (Appendix 8) for guided routing when scenarios are complex.",
    "Organisations should verify local legislative requirements, conditions of prior approvals, and any cross-jurisdictional constraints before proceeding."
