    "Personal information: Information or an opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable, whether the information is true or not and whether recorded in material form or not.",
    "De-identified: Information that is no longer about an identifiable individual or an individual who is reasonably identifiable, after applying appropriate techniques. De-identification reduces but does not necessarily remove all re-identification risk; testing and controls are required.",
    "Very low risk (re-identification): A level of re-identification risk assessed as very low after applying de-identification techniques and evaluation. If risk is more than very low, privacy law obligations continue to apply and a lawful pathway must be found before use or sharing.",
    "Data Custodian / Data Provider (DP): The organisation accountable for lawful handling of source data and for governance decisions regarding synthetic data generation and release.",
    "Data Requestor (DR): The organisation or team seeking access to synthetic data for a defined purpose.",
    "End User (EU): Individuals within the Requestor who will access or analyse the data under approved conditions.",
    "Five Safes: Safe people, safe projects, safe data, safe settings, and safe outputs — a model used in Safety Assessment to ensure proportionate controls before sharing.",
    "Decision tree (Appendix 8): A guided process for complex scenarios where lawful pathways or risk thresholds are uncertain.",
    "Lawful pathways (Appendix 9): Explanations of the legal mechanisms and conditions under which synthetic data may be used or disclosed when risk cannot be reduced to very low."
