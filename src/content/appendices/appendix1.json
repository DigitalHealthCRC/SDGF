    "Synthetic health data are data generated to resemble real health data in structure and statistical properties, without being direct copies of individual records. Their purpose is to enable analysis, development and testing activities while reducing direct privacy risks when compared with using identifiable source data.",
    "Benefits include enabling safer data sharing for public benefit projects, accelerating analytics and model development, improving interoperability testing, and supporting education and system design. Synthetic datasets can be tailored to the specific use case to preserve relationships, distributions and utility necessary for the task.",
    "Protecting privacy with synthetic data requires governance. Even when direct identifiers are removed from source data before generation, there remains the possibility that identity could be reasonably ascertained in context. Organisations must therefore test re-identification risk and treat synthetic data as personal information if the risk is more than very low.",
    "Limitations: synthetic data are not a substitute for clinical-grade truth and may not be suitable where exact per-record accuracy is required. Overfitting or leakage from training data can increase risk; quality and privacy testing are essential.",
    "How this appendix relates to the Framework: it provides plain-language context that underpins Steps 1–5 and the specialised guidance in Appendices 3, 7, 8 and 9."
