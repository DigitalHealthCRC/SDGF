3:T145c,# **Appendix 3: The Policy and Legal Framework Underpinning This Framework**

The system of privacy regulation in Australia is best described as a *“patchwork”*. Given the range of current and potential future SynD members, a range of privacy laws may apply to a single synthetic health data project.

Federal government agencies and private sector organisations are generally regulated by the **Australian Privacy Principles (APPs)**, which sit under the **Privacy Act 1988 (Cth)**.

State/Territory and local government agencies — including public universities — are generally regulated by their own State/Territory privacy laws. Some jurisdictions have multiple privacy laws and multiple sets of privacy principles.

For example:

* **NSW** has

  * Information Protection Principles (IPPs) under the *Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1998 (NSW)* (PPIP Act)
  * Health Privacy Principles (HPPs) under the *Health Records & Information Privacy Act 2002 (NSW)* (HRIP Act)
* **South Australia** currently has *no specific privacy legislation* but has a mandatory **Information Privacy Principles Instruction**, issued by the Department of Premier and Cabinet.

Some private sector organisations must comply with both federal and State/Territory privacy laws. For example, the NSW HRIP Act applies HPPs to *private* health service providers in addition to the federal APPs.

Each privacy law establishes a set of privacy principles that govern:

* Collection
* Use
* Disclosure
* Data security
* Data quality
* Access and correction

Privacy laws generally **prohibit disclosure** of personal information unless an exception applies.
