3:T232c,# **Appendix 9: The Lawful Pathways Explained**

While there are differences between the sets of privacy principles that operate across Australian jurisdictions, there are many commonalities — particularly in how the principles both **facilitate** and **restrict** the sharing of personal information.

Generally, organisations are permitted to collect personal information where the information is **necessary and relevant** for their functions or activities (and in some instances, with the individual’s consent). This is the **primary purpose** of collection. Organisations are then permitted to **use** and **disclose** the information for that primary purpose.

If an organisation wishes to use or disclose personal information for a **secondary purpose**, it must meet at least one of a limited number of **exceptions** under privacy law.

Under privacy law, using and sharing health data for synthetic health data projects will **always** be for a secondary purpose, because the primary purpose for collecting the data was to provide health services to individuals (see Step 1: *Assess the use case*).

Synthetic health data requests generally involve handling personal information at two possible stages, each requiring a lawful pathway:

1. **Selecting and handling the source data** used for synthetic data generation (source data is personal information).
2. **Where synthetic data has more than very low re-identification risk**, and is therefore still considered personal information.

---

# **Multi-Party Projects**

Where an organisation needs to collect personal information from others for synthetic health data generation, privacy and legal risks must be identified and managed.

Examples include:

* A health department disclosing data to another to create a **linked dataset**.
* A health department disclosing data to a **university research team** to generate synthetic health data.

In these scenarios, a **Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)** must be completed. The PIA identifies the appropriate lawful pathway(s) for each participating organisation and the entire data flow.

Possible lawful pathways are explained below. Organisations should also review the **Use and Disclosure** principles in the privacy laws that apply to them (see Appendix 3 for descriptions and links).

---

# **‘Directly Related’ and ‘Within Reasonable Expectations’**

Privacy laws allow the use and sharing of health information for a secondary purpose if:

* The secondary purpose is **directly related** to the primary purpose, and
* The secondary purpose is **within the reasonable expectations** of the individual, and in some cases,
* The organisation has no reason to believe the individual would object.

Example:
Using health information collected for treatment to send an **appointment reminder**.

The NSW Privacy Commissioner describes a “directly related” purpose as something an individual would **reasonably expect** to occur with their personal information.

Examples the NSW Privacy Commissioner considers appropriate include:

* Providing information to someone involved in the patient’s **ongoing care**
* **Investigating and managing incidents or complaints**
* **Monitoring, evaluating or auditing** services
* Managing a **legal claim** made by the patient

If individuals were **not informed** (e.g., via a collection notice) that their information may be used or disclosed for the secondary purpose, reasonable expectation may not be established.

Using or processing personal information for **de-identification** may in some cases be considered a normal business practice that is *incidental or directly related* to the primary purpose.

### **Practical perspective**

Using health information to generate synthetic health data can meet this pathway where:

* The use case has a **clear public benefit** related to health services
* The goal is to create a **de-identified** synthetic dataset with significantly reduced risk
* Reasonable **consumer expectations** have been set about how their health information may be used

These are reflected in **Appendix 4 — Use Case Assessment** and are explained in Step 1 of the Framework.

---

# **With Consent**

Personal information may be used or disclosed for a secondary purpose if valid **consent** is obtained.

To be valid, consent must be:

* **Voluntary**
* **Informed**
* **Specific**
* **Current**
* **Given by a person with capacity**

Consent must specifically cover:

* The **purpose**
* The **organisations** involved in handling the information

Express consent (ticking a box, signing a form, verbally saying yes) is easier to evidence than implied consent.

Mechanisms must exist to:

* Record consent
* Manage withdrawal of consent

If earlier collected data did not include consent for synthetic data use, new consent must be obtained — unless another lawful pathway is available.

### **Practical limitations**

Obtaining consent is generally **not feasible** for large-scale synthetic health data projects, especially when data has already been collected.

---

# **Seeking Ethics Approval: Management of Health Services & Research Projects**

Most privacy laws provide exceptions for using and sharing health information for:

* **Management of health services**, and
* **Research purposes**

Both often require **Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC)** approval.

HREC approval must cover:

* Any **disclosure** between organisations
* The **collection** and **use** of information to generate synthetic data

For multi-jurisdictional projects, organisations should seek a single review from a **nationally certified HREC** under the **National Mutual Acceptance (NMA) scheme**.

Where synthetic data is still personal information due to re-identification risk, HREC approval with **waiver of consent** is usually the most appropriate lawful pathway.

---

# **Required or Authorised Under Another Law**

Personal information may be collected, used or disclosed if:

* It is **required** under law, or
* It is **authorised** under law

If required, there is **no choice** (e.g., compulsory production under law enforcement powers).
If authorised, the organisation may choose to act within the permitted scope.

The OAIC warns that:

> A practice is not “authorised” by law simply because no law prohibits it.
> Authorization must be **clear and direct**.

Examples include:

* Laws governing an organisation’s **functions or services**
* The **Data Availability and Transparency Act 2022 (Cth)**, which authorises certain data sharing

---

# **Effectively De-Identified to Be Safe for Sharing**

Only **robustly and effectively de-identified** data can be considered safe to share.

Under privacy law, de-identification must be understood in reference to **personal information**:

> De-identified data means the person’s identity is no longer apparent, or cannot reasonably be ascertained.

Even after removing direct identifiers, data may still be identifiable if identity can be re-established:

* Using other datasets
* Using contextual information

The Australian Privacy Commissioner warns that:

> De-identification may reduce, but does not eliminate, the risk of re-identification.

Key points:

* Identifiability includes the ability to **distinguish** someone, not just name them
* De-identification must be **tested**
* Some laws (e.g., WA PRIS Act) still regulate certain aspects of de-identified data (e.g., overseas transfers, prohibition on re-identification)

Only data with **very low** re-identification risk can be considered safe for sharing.

Data may be considered de-identified in one context (e.g., a secure enclave) but **re-identifiable** in another (e.g., publicly released).

Re-identification risk is **not static** and must be re-assessed if:

* Context changes
* Environment changes
* New data becomes available
* A model or related data becomes exposed

This Framework relies on this pathway where synthetic data has been de-identified to the point that it is no longer personal information.

---

# **Other Exceptions**

Privacy laws may include additional exceptions, such as:

* Temporary **Public Interest Directions (PID)**
* Permanent **Health Privacy Codes of Practice (HPCOP)**
* Equivalent mechanisms in other jurisdictions

Some exceptions (e.g., law enforcement, serious threats, missing persons) are **not relevant** for synthetic health data.
